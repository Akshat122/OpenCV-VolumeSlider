This is my "Hello World" project in the fields of computer vision and machine learning.
This project demonstrates that with help of OpenCV anything can be controlled without physically touching it. All we need is crazy ideas and passion.

I have used the following libraries to build the project.

*  OpenCV
*  Mediapipe
